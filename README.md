## Inspiration:
The 90s!

## What it does:
Quizzes you on the most important pop culture decade of our time.

## How we built it:
Google queries, MVC design pattern, Java package manipulations, and loads of communication with a little bit of stubbornness.

## Challenges we ran into
Loads of Git conflicts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting a GUI to run using local files and playing a partial round of the game as designed.

## What we learned
A lot of time management, organization, and the importance of delegations. Also how to learn a ton of code in short amount of time. And clear communication skills!

## What's next for Name That 90's Music Video!
In a time of virtual hangouts, we needed something to take us back to a better time, when concerts were live, hits were unforgettable, and capri pants were all the rage.

Built With: awt, gui, java, swing
