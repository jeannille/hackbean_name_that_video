## Inspiration:
The 90s!

## What it does:
Quizzes you on the most important pop culture decade of our time.

## How we built it:
Google queries, MVC design pattern, Java package manipulations, and loads of communication with a little bit of stubbornness.

## Challenges we ran into
Loads of Git conflicts: testing different parts of our program separately (all via different coasts!) caused a lot of merge conflicts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting a GUI to run using local files and playing a partial round of the game as designed.

## What we learned
A lot of time management, organization, and the importance of delegations. Also how to learn a ton of code in short amount of time. And clear communication skills! Proper workflow and planning is crucial to a well-rounded and maintainable project.
Due to our challenges with Git, we strengthened our skills in utilizing the intelliJ GUI for version control which resolved a lot of confusion towards the end. The interface for merge conflicts is impressive. We also got exposed to branches and pull requests (to avoid these types of issues in the future) for best practice.

## What's next for Name That 90's Music Video!
In a time of virtual hangouts, we needed something to take us back to a better time, when concerts were live, hits were unforgettable, and capri pants were all the rage.

Built With: awt, gui, java, swing
